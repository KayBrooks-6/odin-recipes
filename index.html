                    <p>Now this recipe was an treasure to find, and if you follow her way to make the broth homemade,
                        then it really brings out the flavor! But if you just don't have the time for that, then 
                        add in a low sodium instant stock, and some sherry, and it is just such a nice hearty soup to 
                        cozy up with.</p>
