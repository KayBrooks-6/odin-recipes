        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love how much neat things you can find at thrift stores every so often. This recipe book I 
            got, <em>"Better Homes and Gardens Stir-Fry Recipes"</em>, has been one of my main cooking books I use. Lots of 
            great recipes that are such a great time to make, even though it was published in 1985. This recipe is 
            one of my favorites as it's so easy to make, and if you don't have nectarines, peaches work too!</p>
        
        <p>This recipe basically makes a simple sweet and sour sauce using honey, red wine vinegar, and fruit juice or nectar. 
            Then add in whatever meat or vegetables you want and there you go!For me sliced up summer sausages really added a 
            nice mix to the sweetness. But heres a few things of note: if you stir fry carrots, cut them thin so that they don't 
            burn as they can take a while to fry, or precook them a bit first. Also, only add enough peach slices for that serving 
            and put them in a container in the fridge. I found that if I made a big batch for lots of leftovers, adding peaches 
            all at once would make them very mushy in a day or two. Still tasty, but that texture of more solid peaches is better
            when done the other way. Enjoys!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb meat of choice, or if you more vegetables fruit, go for it!</li>
            <li>1 cup peach or apricot nectar or juice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of red wine vinegar: can add more if want more sour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of cooking oil for stirfrying</li>
            <li>1 carrot thinly sliced - about 1/3 cup</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper sliced into think strips-about 3/4 cup</li>
            <li>4 medium nectarines sliced</li>
            <li>rice or noodles </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the sauce, mix together the nectar/juice, honey -best warmed for 30 secs in the microwave, vinegar,
                cornstarch, and soy sauce. Set it aside for now while the vegetables and meat fry.</li>
            <li>On a frypan or wok, preheat on high heat and add the cooking oil. Stir fry the carrots until they are the 
                texture you want, stir well to prevent burning and add extra oil if needed. </li>
            <li>At this point, add in other vegetables like the bell peppers or even celery and fry for a minute. Don't worry
                about them being too raw, the heat later on will soften them up nicely.</li>
            <li>Push the vegetables to the sides of the pan to make an opening in the center. Add in the meat, if you use 
                cooked sausage, you only need to cook a bit.</li>
            <li>Now push everything away from center of pan, and add in the sauce. Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.
                Then stir all the ingredients together coating everything in the sauce. If using nectarines, add in the slices
                at this point, and it is ready to serve! </li>
            <li>Turn off heat, and add stirfry mixture on some rice or noodles, while adding slices of peaches/nectarines, and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
