        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love how much neat things you can find at thrift stores every so often. This recipe book I 
            got, <em>"Better Homes and Gardens Stir-Fry Recipes"</em>, has been one of my main cooking books I use. Lots of 
            great recipes that are such a great time to make, even though it was published in 1985. This recipe is 
            one of my favorites as it's so easy to make, and if you don't have nectarines, peaches work too!</p>
        
        <p>This recipe basically makes a simple sweet and sour sauce using honey, red wine vinegar, and fruit juice or nectar. 
            Then add in whatever meat or vegetables you want and there you go!For me sliced up summer sausages really added a 
            nice mix to the sweetness. But heres a few things of note: if you stir fry carrots, cut them thin so that they don't 
            burn as they can take a while to fry, or precook them a bit first. Also, only add enough peach slices for that serving 
            and put them in a container in the fridge. I found that if I made a big batch for lots of leftovers, adding peaches 
            all at once would make them very mushy in a day or two. Still tasty, but that texture of more solid peaches is better
            when done the other way. Enjoys!</p>
