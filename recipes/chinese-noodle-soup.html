        This is a picture of the finished Chinese Noodle Soup made by Nagi from RecipeTinEats</a>
        <p>Now this recipe was an treasure to find, and if you follow her way to make the broth homemade,
            then it really brings out the flavor! But if you just don't have the time for that, then 
            add in a low sodium instant stock, and some sherry, and it is just such a nice hearty soup to 
            cozy up with.</p>

        <p>As you can see, this is a nice version of chicken noodle soup that gives really rich, and 
            deep flavors, and honestly the wine and a <em>dash</em> of toasted sesame oil brings it right
            to life! Too much of the sesame oil, and it"ll overpower the rest of flavors in the soup.
            Then you can add whatever veggies you have in your fridge or freezer, and away you go! </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <h2> Steps to make this dish!</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>First is to boil the stock and get that simmering.</li>
                    <li>Add in the soy sauce, wine, sugar, and sesame oil</li>
                    <li>Cut up the ginger into small slices and smash the garlic with the flat of the blade,
                        cut up into small pieces, and put both into pot.</li>
                    <li>Simmer everything for 10 minutes, and enjoy with noodles and veggies.</li>
                    <li>For the bok choy, if you cut into 1/4's, and simmer the pieces in the pot of water that cooked the
                        noodles for a few minutes, it'll make them softer and taste much better!</li>
                </ol>
